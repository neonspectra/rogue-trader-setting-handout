I created this handout because I wanted to run a Rogue Trader game for a new group with little to no familiarity to the Warhammer 40k universe. 

Given how vast, complicated, and hard to get into this setting is, my goal with this handout is to convey the absolute bare minimum "shit you need to know" in an economical single-page handout. Be aware that I've generalised, glossed over, and dumbed down a lot of details to ensure that all the text fits onto two sides of a single sheet of paper. Consider this a conversation starter for your players! :)

Nobody likes being given a boring wall of text to read, so I've spruced up the layout to make the handout feel more immersive and easier on the eyes so that my players are more likely to actually read it.

## Full-Bleed Printing

In order to do a full bleed duplex print, we need to print the handout centred on B4 so that we can trim it down to B4. We can do this with `pdfjam`.

I'm gonna be honest: the tex devops ecosystem is a nightmare and Ubuntu's repos (which GH Actions native runners run on) are an even bigger nightmare, so I have not even bothered to try and make a centred fullbleed print layout autmated in CI. Instead, I have just been manually throwing together a print copy of this on my local system in a throwaway nix shell because that's easier.

Anyway here's how I do that:

Install `pdfjam`, poppler, and ghostscript into a Nix shell (tested on NixOS 25.05):

```bash
nix-shell -p texlive.combined.scheme-full poppler_utils ghostscript
```

Then we need to centre it on B4 so that if we print it in duplex both sides will line up:

```bash
pdfjam handout-a4.pdf \
  --papersize '{250mm,353mm}' \
  --noautoscale true \
  --scale 1 \
  --offset '0cm 0cm' \
  --outfile handout_fullbleed_b4.pdf
```

Alternatively, for US paper sizes:

```bash
pdfjam handout-a4.pdf \
  --papersize '{11in,17in}' \
  --noautoscale true \
  --scale 1 \
  --offset '0cm 0cm' \
  --outfile handout_fullbleed_us-tabloid.pdf
```

Remember to print with flip on long edge when printing in duplex so that the back side isn't upside down.
