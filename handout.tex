\rpgsection{Intro}
\textit{It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.}

\textit{To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim darkness of the far future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage, slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.}

\rpgsection{Basic History}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Imperium of Man is a theocratic fascist regime that extends to every corner of the galaxy, encompassing billions of worlds inhabited by quadrillions of people united by their worship of the God-Emperor of Mankind.
  \item The Emperor is the most powerful psychic being who ever existed, but he is slowly dying. He has been on life support in a vegetative state for about 10,000 years after being mortally wounded in a failed coup by his closest advisor.
  \item It would be blasphemous to admit it, but the Imperium of Man has been in a steady decline ever since the Emperor was struck down and rendered comatose. It is likely no one will ever know the full extent of all that has been lost, as written history only goes back about 10,000 years at best.
\end{itemize}

\rpgsection{Who are Rogue Traders?}
\textit{We must each of us occupy our preordained particular position. Would you wear a shoe on your head? Of course you wouldn't wear a shoe on your head. A shoe doesn't belong on your head. A shoe belongs on your foot. A hat belongs on your head. I am a hat. You are a shoe. I belong on the head. You belong on the foot.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A Rogue Trader is basically a space trillionaire oligarch who wields a sacred document called a Warrant of Trade, signed thousands of years ago by the Emperor himself and passed down through the Rogue Trader's family lineage. 
  \item You play as the Rogue Trader and their immediate retinue of commanding officers. You serve as the top-level leaders of the Rogue Trader's flagship: think “Star Trek” bridge crew, but as Machiavellian warrior nobility.
  \item The Warrant of Trade grants the Rogue Trader autonomy from Imperial authority— the right to venture into the far reaches of uncivilised space and plunder wealth for the Imperium by any means necessary.
  \item As the Rogue Trader’s bloodline is divinely ordained, their word is law within their domain. In practice, the Rogue Trader holds immense power derived from the wealth of planets and subjects that make up their personal fiefdom.
  \item However, the nobility of an illustrious Rogue Trader is precarious. Their autonomy can swing both ways: other agents of the Imperium are not obligated to assist the Rogue Trader in their time of need. And, remember, if you have anything of value in this harsh world, there will always be someone or something conniving to take it from you.
\end{itemize}

\rpgsection{Society}
\textit{Faith. Honour. Vigilance. An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded. Facts are chains that bind perception and fetter truth. Those who are small minded in their faith are blessed as they will not fall or stray into corruption.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Imperium of Man is best defined by its wanton disregard for the value of human life. The very concepts of individual agency, self determination, and democracy that we take for granted are utterly alien to most Imperial denizens.
  \item Society in the Imperium of Man has been organised around the uncompromising worship of the God-Emperor. To worship any other deity or to worship none is heresy and is punishable by death.
  \item Humanity is made as a reflection of the Emperor’s holy form. Genetic abnormalities, mutations, and alien life are all considered heretical affronts to His holiness and are thus punishable by death.
  \item Curiosity is dangerous. Innovation is the road to heresy. “Monkey see, monkey do” is how the day-to-day affairs of the Imperium continue to run themselves as the empire declines.
\end{itemize}

\rpgsection{Technology}
\textit{Great Maker, whose Motive Force infused this servant once with the spark of life and service to the machine. Whose blessed algorithms guided, whose oils consecrated and whose augmentations made more of this once-true construct than he could ever have been. Embrace the glorious workings of this, Your servant, and admit him once more to the wondrous interface of godly communion.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Technology and its proliferation is considered dangerous. Artificial intelligence is categorically heretical.
  \item The use, distribution, and understanding of all technological devices in the Imperium is highly regulated by an insular priestly order called the Adeptus Mechanicus.
  \item The Adeptus Mechanicus worship a machine god called the Omnissiah. They replace their body parts with crude mechanical augmentations as a way of communing with the Omnissiah.
  \item Members of the Cult Mechanicus believe that their reverence of the Omnissiah grants them the ability as well as the right to operate technology through prayer, communion, and appeasement of the machine spirits that reside within technological devices.
\end{itemize}

\rpgsection{Space Travel}
\

\begin{itemize}
\textit{Between the stars the ancient unseen enemies of mankind wait and hunger. Every voyage into the nothing is a confrontation with horror, with the implacable things of the Warp, and with man's own innermost fears.}

  \item Spacecraft (known as void craft or voidships) are gargantuan. They can span kilometres in size and generally contain a population of \textasciitilde15,000–30,000 people on a single ship.
  \item Voidships are hundreds to thousands of years old, with the technology to build them often having been lost. Most inhabitants of a voidship were born there, have never left, and have family histories going back many generations on the same ship.
  \item Ships achieve FTL by travelling through a hellish alternate dimension full of daemons called the Warp. This works basically like the Nether in Minecraft.
  \item A three-eyed mutant human called a Navigator is required to navigate the Warp. A ship’s Navigator looks directly into the Warp with their third eye to see the Emperor’s psychic signature on Terra as their North Star to determine the ship’s heading.
\end{itemize}

\rpgsection{The Warp}
\textit{I have seen darkness, witnessed it in my dreams. I am standing at the edge of a chasm. There is no escaping it; I know my fate. For it is the future and nothing can prevent it coming to pass. So I step off and welcome the dark.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Warp is a manifestation of every human and non-human’s soul and emotions. It is full of daemons and other unspeakable horrors, all of which serve evil Chaos Gods and feed off of pure suffering and malice.
  \item Unfiltered exposure to the Warp causes immediate insanity and horrific mutation to any human who is not a Navigator. Being corrupted by the Warp taints your mind with the influence of the aforementioned Chaos Gods.
  \item People with an innate connection to the Warp are called ‘psykers’ and have psychic powers. Their existence is rare, dangerous, and illegal (except when they’re a Navigator or are otherwise sanctioned).
  \item Voidships are protected from the daemonic influence of the Warp via a force field called a Gellar field. Gellar fields are imperfect, and it’s not uncommon for fluctuations in void travel to cause eldritch daemonic horrors to appear on voidships and kill people, drive them insane, or much worse.
\end{itemize}
